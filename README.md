# 🌍 Global Out-of-School Children Analysis (1970–2023)

This project analyzes the proportion of **children of primary school age not enrolled in school (OOSC)**, based on the **World Bank Indicator SE.PRM.UNER.ZS**.

---

## 🚀 **Key Highlights**

- **Data Source:** World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Core skills practiced:**
  - Data loading and cleaning (skiprows, melt)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
  - Merging datasets
  - Building multivariate regression models

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

1. Understand global education access trends over time
2. Identify countries with highest OOSC rates
3. Build regression models to quantify the impact of GDP per capita and year on OOSC rates

---

## 📊 **Key Findings**

- **Global OOSC rates are declining** but remain high in specific countries.
- **GDP per capita negatively correlates** with OOSC rate: wealthier countries tend to have fewer out-of-school children.
- **Linear regression model** confirms expected relationships; future work will include real GDP data and additional features.

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**

- Integrate **real GDP data** from World Bank API
- Explore additional predictors (e.g. education spending, urbanization rate)
- Deploy model insights for **policy recommendations**
